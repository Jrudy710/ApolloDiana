This is a program that will read from a file, with the first line in the file representing the row and column values for a 2 dimensional array. The program will then pass the rest of the information from the file into a 2-d array, which after the rest of the information from the file has been passed into the grid the program will start at the top left of the grid and look for the target position which we were informed is at the bottom right of the array. The program will perform this traversal by using a form of astar search to find the most optimal path, and then return that path to the user. The assumption is that any given grid will have at least one possible path from the start state to the target state.
